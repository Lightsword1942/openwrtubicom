		       ISC DHCP Port to OpenWrt
			    Version 4.1.0
			   December 8, 2008

This package includes files to support ISC DHCP 4.1.0 on OpenWrt.
Much of this work is based on the original "dhcp" package, which was
based on ISC DHCP 3.1.0, and which was developed outside of ISC.

			     NEW FEATURES

- Support has been added for the DHCP client (missing from the
  original OpenWrt package).

- DHCP 4.x includes support for DHCPv6, so .init and .conf files have
  been added for v6 client and server.

		   CHANGES SINCE November 20, 2008

- Tested on Kamikaze 7.09 and 8.09-RC1.

- Added a menuconfig sub-menu for components and v6 support.  Adding
  the "dhcpv6" pseudo-package enables v6 support to all configured
  apps, and adds the kmod-ipv6 package.

- v4 and v6 no longer overwrite each other's /etc/resolv.conf.

			KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS

- The values in dhcpd.conf and dhcpd6.conf are examples only, and are
  meant to be changed.

- The relay agent has not been tested.  (This was a limitation in the
  original OpenWrt package as well.)  When it is tested, .init and
  .conf files will be added.

- There is no integration with any web interface, be it X-Wrt, LuCI, etc.

- Hotplug has not been tested.

Any feedback (positive or negative) is appreciated.  Please feel free
to contact the author directly at pselkirk@isc.org.  Mail sent to
dhcp-bugs@isc.org will be forwarded to me anyway, and mail sent to
dhcp-users@isc.org will no doubt be met with confusion.
